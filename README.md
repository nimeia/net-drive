# Developer Mount

Developer Mount is a Windows-first, editor-optimized remote filesystem project.

This repository currently contains:
- protocol and architecture documents for Iter 0
- a control-plane baseline from Iter 1
- read-only metadata and file access from Iter 2
- metadata cache and directory snapshot logic from Iter 3
- write/save-path baseline from Iter 4
- watcher and journal polling baseline from Iter 5
- recovery and reconnect baseline from Iter 6
- editor-focused optimizations from Iter 7
- productization closure: config loading, status endpoints, audit logging, and packaging scripts

## Current scope

The current code implements:
- control channel: hello / auth / create session / resume session / heartbeat
- metadata channel: lookup / getattr / opendir / readdir / rename
- data channel: open / create / read / write / flush / truncate / set-delete-on-close / close
- events channel: subscribe / poll events / ack / resync snapshot
- recovery channel: recover handles / revalidate nodes / resubscribe watches
- metadata cache / negative cache / dir snapshot cache / root prefetch
- workspace profile / hot dir-file prefetch / small-file cache / priority-aware prefetch
- product-facing runtime pieces: JSON config, `/healthz`, `/status`, JSONL audit log, build/package scripts

It does not yet implement:
- WinFsp integration
- push-style watcher streaming
- lease / oplock-style invalidation
- full Windows file semantic coverage
- full handle replay semantics

```

## Test

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Productized startup

```bash
go run ./cmd/devmount-server -config ./configs/devmount.example.json
```

Health and status:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:17891/healthz
curl http://127.0.0.1:17891/status
```

## Demo

Start the server with direct flags:

```bash
go run ./cmd/devmount-server -root /path/to/workspace
```

In another terminal, run the demo client:

```bash
go run ./cmd/devmount-client
```
